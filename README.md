Sticking an Element when Scrolling
=======================

This is a jQuery plugin to make an element scroll with the page inside the boundaries of a specified container.

There are many plugins like this, but this one was built to be simple and lightweight, with no frills nor extra features.

## Usage

- Download from [GitHub][download], or `npm install jquery-sticky-element` if you're using [NPM][npm]
- Include jQuery & Sticky Element
- Invoke Sticky Element on the desired DOM element(s)

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.stickyelement.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
    $(document).ready(function(){
        // Without options
        $('scrolling_item_selector').sticky('scrolling_container_selector');
        
        // With options
        $('scrolling_item_selector').sticky('scrolling_container_selector', {
            useTransition: false,
            animate: true,
            animTime: 1000
        });
    });
</script>
```

You can pass in a class or ID into either one. Note that the container will get set to position relative.

## Options

| Name  | Default | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| useTransition | true | Use native CSS3 `transition` property (recommended) |
| animate | true | Use jQuery animate function |
| animTime | 200 | Time it takes for animation to complete in `ms` |
| animDelay | 300 | Delay until the animation starts in `ms`, used only if `animate` is `true` |
| offset | 0 | Offset the sticky element, useful if you have a fixed header that scrolls with the page |

**Note**: If you set `useTransition` to `true`, `animate` will always be treated as `false`

## Methods

You can call various methods on a sticky element instance

| Name  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `update` | Updates the position and boundaries of the element |
| `toggleFreeze` | Toggles whether the element will move based off the scroll position |
| `setBoundaries` | Updates the top and bottom boundaries of the element |
| `moveIt` | Manually move the element to the scroll position within its parent boundaries (useful if the element is frozen) | 
| `setOffset` | Update the offset of the sticky element | 

### Example usage:

```javascript
// This will update the sticky element's offset
$('#sticky').sticky('setOffset', 50);
```

## Events

| Name  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `sticky-created` | Fired when the sticky element is created and ready to move |
| `sticky-update` | Fired when the element's update method is called to update boundaries |
| `sticky-hit-top` | Fired when the element reaches the top of it's container |
| `sticky-hit-bottom` | Fired when the element reaches the bottom of it's container |
| `sticky-frozen` | Fired when the element is frozen |
| `sticky-unfrozen` | Fired when the element is unfrozen |

### Example usage:
```javascript
$('#sticky').on('sticky-created', function(event){
  console.log('Sticky element created', event.target);
});
```
