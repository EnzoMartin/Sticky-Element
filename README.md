Sticking an Element when Scrolling
=======================

This is a jQuery plugin to make an element scroll with the page, with the option of making it only move inside the boundaries of a specified container.

###Usage:
```javascript
$('.sidebar').sticky('.container');
```
Optionally you can leave it blank to make it stick to the window instead:
```javascript
$('.sidebar').sticky();
